## Setup

To setup the project on your machine

- Clone the project to your machine.
- Go to the project folder, and create a virtual environment.
  - You open the command-line and type `python -m venv .venv`. Note that you need 3.7.7 or higher for pygame (we use 3.8). 
- After you created a virtual environment, activate it:
  - Open the command-line on windows and type `.venv\Scripts\activate.bat`. If you have macOS or Linux, you need do it differently. Try google it.
- Now run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required dependencies.
